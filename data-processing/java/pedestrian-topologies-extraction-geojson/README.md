# A Compiler to Extract Pedestrian Topologies into GeoJSON

This Data Processing Library Java example shows how to use the Open Location
Platform SDK to build a compiler pipeline that extracts all pedestrian topologies for a
particular input catalog.

The compiler in this example is an incremental RefTreeCompiler which
takes HERE Map Content input data, finds all pedestrian topologies, and produces output
tiles in GeoJSON Format. The output of this compiler is the `pedestriansegments` layer GeoJSON
HEREtile format.

## Set up Access to the Data API

To run the example, you need access to a HERE Map Content catalog, and you need to create one catalog of
your own. For more information, refer to the
[Open Location Platform SDK](https://developer.here.com/olp/documentation/sdk-developer-guide/content/dev_guide/index.html) and
[Portal](https://developer.here.com/olp/documentation) documentation.

### Create the Pedestrian Topologies Catalog

The catalog you need to create is used to store the pedestrian topologies generated by a compiler.

Using the OLP Portal, create a new catalog and the following catalog layers:

| Layer ID           | Layer Type | Partitioning | Zoom Level | Content Type             | Content Encoding |
|--------------------|------------|--------------|------------|--------------------------|------------------|
| pedestriansegments | Versioned  | HEREtile     | 14         | application/vnd.geo+json | uncompressed     |
| state              | Versioned  | Generic      | N.A.       | application/octet-stream | uncompressed     |

Alternatively, you can use the OLP CLI to create a catalog and the corresponding layers.
In the commands that follow replace the variable placeholders with the following values:
- `$CATALOG_ID` is your output catalog's ID.
- `$CATALOG_HRN` is your output catalog's `HRN` (returned by `olp catalog create`).
- `$GROUP_ID` is the credentials group ID your HERE user belongs to.

* First, create an output catalog and grant the correct permission to your group:

```bash
olp catalog create $CATALOG_ID $CATALOG_ID --summary "Pedestrian topologies extracted from HERE Map Content" \
            --description "Pedestrian topologies extracted from HERE Map Content"
olp catalog permission grant $CATALOG_HRN --group $GROUP_ID --read --write --manage
```

* Next, add layers to the catalog you have just created:

```bash
olp catalog layer add $CATALOG_HRN pedestriansegments pedestriansegments --versioned --summary "pedestrian segments" \
            --description "pedestrian segments" --partitioning heretile:14 --content-type application/vnd.geo+json
olp catalog layer add $CATALOG_HRN state state --versioned --summary "state" --description "state" \
            --partitioning Generic --content-type application/octet-stream
```

For more details on how to create a catalog and its layers refer to the
[Data User Guide](https://developer.here.com/olp/documentation/data-user-guide/content/index.html), particularly
[Create a Catalog](https://developer.here.com/olp/documentation/data-user-guide/content/portal/catalog-creating.html) and
[Create a Layer](https://developer.here.com/olp/documentation/data-user-guide/content/portal/layer-creating.html).

### Set up Local Data Access

To run the compiler locally, you also need to create an app key, download the properties file for
that app key to your computer, and grant your app access to your catalog.

For details on how you can obtain the necessary credentials, see
[Get Credentials](https://developer.here.com/olp/documentation/access-control/user-guide/content/topics/get-credentials.html).

## Configure the Compiler

From the SDK examples directory, open the `data-processing/java/pedestrian-topologies-extraction-geojson` project in your
Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

The `compiler/config/here/pipeline-config.conf` (for the HERE OLP environment) and
`compiler/config/here-china/pipeline-config.conf` (for the HERE OLP China environment) files contain
the permanent configuration of the data sources for the compiler.

Pick the file that corresponds to your OLP environment. For example, the pipeline configuration for
the HERE OLP environment looks like:

```javascript
pipeline.config {
  output-catalog {hrn = "YOUR_OUTPUT_CATALOG_HRN"}
  input-catalogs {
    rib {hrn = "hrn:here:data::olp-here:rib-2"}
  }
}
```
Replace `YOUR_OUTPUT_CATALOG_HRN` with the HRN of your pedestrian topologies catalog.
To find the HRN, in the [OLP Portal](https://platform.here.com/) or the [OLP China
Portal](https://platform.hereolp.cn/), navigate to your catalog. The HRN is displayed in the upper
left corner of page.

The `config/here/pipeline-job.conf` and `config/here-china/pipeline-job.conf` files
contain the compiler's run configuration.

In this file, modify `version = 1` to reflect the version of the HERE Map Content catalog you want
to process.  To find the version of the HERE Map Content catalog, in the [OLP
Portal](https://platform.here.com/) or the [OLP China Portal](https://platform.hereolp.cn/),
navigate to the HERE Map Content catalog; the current version number is displayed in the upper left
corner of page.

The remainder of the configuration is specified in the `application.conf` found in the
`src/main/resources` directory of the compiler project. But you do not have to modify it unless
you want to change the behavior of the compiler.

## Build the Compiler

To build the compiler, run `mvn install` in the `pedestrian-topologies-extraction-geojson` directory.

## Run the Compiler Locally

To run the compiler locally, you will need to run the entry point to the compiler:

- `com.here.platform.data.processing.example.java.pedestrian.geojson.Main`

As _arguments_ you must provide the `--master` _parameter_ with the address of the Spark server
master to connect to, and any configuration parameters you want to override. Alternatively, you
can add those parameters to the `application.conf` file.

Additionally, you also need to specify the `-Dpipeline-config.file` and `-Dpipeline-job.file` _parameters_
to specify the location of a configuration file that contains the catalogs as well as job-specific versions
of the catalogs, to read and write to.

For local runs, a bounding box filter is provided in the
`compile/config/here/local-application.conf` and `compile/config/here-china/local-application.conf` to
limit the number of partitions to be processed. This speeds up the compilation process. In this
example, we use a bounding box around the city of Berlin and Beijing for the HERE OLP and HERE OLP
China environments respectively. You can edit the bounding box coordinates to compile a different
partition of HERE Map Content. Make sure you update the layer coverage to reflect the different
geographical region. In order to use this configuration file, you need to use the `-Dconfig.file`
parameter.

### Run the Compiler from the Command Line

Finally run the following command line in the
`pedestrian-topologies-extraction-geojson` directory to run the Pedestrian Topologies Compiler.

For the HERE OLP environment:

```bash
mvn exec:java \
-Dexec.mainClass=com.here.platform.data.processing.example.java.pedestrian.geojson.Main \
-Dpipeline-config.file=./config/here/pipeline-config.conf \
-Dpipeline-job.file=./config/here/pipeline-job.conf \
-Dconfig.file=./config/here/local-application.conf \
-Dexec.args="--master local[*]"
```

For the HERE OLP China environment:

```bash
mvn exec:java \
-Dexec.mainClass=com.here.platform.data.processing.example.java.pedestrian.geojson.Main \
-Dpipeline-config.file=./config/here-china/pipeline-config.conf \
-Dpipeline-job.file=./config/here-china/pipeline-job.conf \
-Dconfig.file=./config/here-china/local-application.conf \
-Dexec.args="--master local[*]"
```

## Run this Compiler as an Open Location Platform Pipeline

### Generate a Fat JAR file:

Run the `mvn -Pplatform package` command in the `pedestrian-topologies-extraction-geojson` directory
to generate a fat JAR file to deploy the compiler to a Pipeline.

```bash
mvn -Pplatform package
```

### Deploy The Compiler to a Pipeline:

Once the previous command is finished, your JAR is then available at the `target` directory, and you
can upload it using the [HERE OLP Pipelines UI](https://platform.here.com/pipelines) (the
[HERE OLP China Pipelines UI](https://platform.hereolp.cn/pipelines) in China)
or the [Open Location Platform CLI](https://developer.here.com/olp/documentation/open-location-platform-cli).

You can use the OLP CLI to create pipeline components and activate it, with the following commands:
* Create pipeline components:

```bash
olp pipeline create $COMPONENT_NAME_Pipeline $GROUP_ID
olp pipeline template create $COMPONENT_NAME_Template batch-2.1.0 $PATH_TO_JAR \
                com.here.platform.data.processing.example.java.pedestrian.geojson.Main $GROUP_ID \
                --workers=4 --worker-units=3 --supervisor-units=2 --input-catalog-ids=rib
olp pipeline version create $COMPONENT_NAME_version $PIPELINE_ID $PIPELINE_TEMPLATE_ID \
                "$PATH_TO_CONFIG_FOLDER/pipeline-config.conf"
```

* Activate the pipeline version:

```bash
olp pipeline version activate $PIPELINE_ID $PIPELINE_VERSION_ID --input-catalogs "$PATH_TO_CONFIG_FOLDER/pipeline-job.conf"
```

You don't have to specify the input catalog's version, unless you want
to. The latest version will be automatically used.

## Verify the Output

In the [OLP Portal](https://platform.here.com/) / [OLP China Portal](https://platform.hereolp.cn/)
select the _Data_ tab and find your catalog.
- Open `pedestriansegments` layer and select the _Inspect_ tab.
- On the map, navigate to the location of your bounding box and set the zoom to level 10.
- Finally, select any highlighted partition to view the results displayed on the map.

Results should be drawn on the map.
